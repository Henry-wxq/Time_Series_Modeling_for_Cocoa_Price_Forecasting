# Time Series Modeling for Cocoa Price Forecasting

**Time Series Modeling for Cocoa Price Forecasting**
*STA457 Time Series Analysis Capstone Project* · Jan 2025 – Apr 2025

* Built 1994–2024 monthly cocoa-price and climate data and compared ETS/ARIMA/SARIMA/ARMA–GARCH, climate-lagged linear regression, and XGBoost; the linear model cut MAPE from 19% to 5.4%.
* Engineered log-differenced price and lag features with weather covariates, ran residual diagnostics and walk-forward XGBoost validation, and generated 10-year cocoa-price scenarios for hedging, procurement, and farmer income support.
